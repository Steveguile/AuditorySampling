# Welcome to the Auditory Sampler

This project was created as a final year project under the **Computing** course for **Bournemouth University**. The purpose of this project is to implement a system that accurately predicts the occurrence of road traffic incidents from auditory data.

It does this by **synthetically generating** data, performing **binary classification** on generated data, and displaying predictions on a lightweight **web application** .
